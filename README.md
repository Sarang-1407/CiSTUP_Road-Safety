# 🚦 CiSTUP Road Safety Project Repository 🛣️

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the *CiSTUP* Road Safety Project, where we collaborate to enhance road safety through data-driven, behavioral and geo analysis resulting in innovative solutions, and policy recommendations.  This repository is a collaborative effort by interns working under Dr. Vijay Kovvali at *Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore*.

## 🎯 Our Mission:
Our mission is to leverage data science, psychological insights, and geoinformatics to enhance road safety, particularly in low-income countries. By combining our expertise, we aim to analyze road accident data, understand driving behaviors, and identify accident-prone areas/blackspots to develop effective interventions and policy recommendations.

## 🔍 Explore Our Research:
This repository hosts datasets, code, research papers, documentation, and resources related to our ongoing road safety research initiatives. Dive into our data analysis, machine learning models, and visualization tools developed to understand and mitigate road accidents.

## 🛠️ Contribute and Collaborate:
As an intern-driven project, we welcome contributions from fellow interns, researchers, and contributors passionate about road safety. Whether you're interested in data analysis, programming, urban planning, or policy development, there's a place for you to contribute.

## 🌟 Our Goals:
1. Analyze road accident data to identify patterns and risk factors.
2. Develop predictive models to forecast accident hotspots and trends.
3. Understanding driving behavior, psychology and creating a guideline for the same.
4. Design interventions and solutions to improve road safety outcomes.
5. Engage with stakeholders and policymakers to advocate for evidence-based policies.

## 📚 Get Started:
1. Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Explore existing code, datasets, and documentation.
3. Create branches for new features, bug fixes, or enhancements.
4. Submit pull requests and engage in discussions with fellow contributors.
5. Stay updated with project developments and announcements through the repository's communication channels.
